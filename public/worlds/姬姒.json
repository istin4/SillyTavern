            "content": "<周易1>\n第1卦 乾\n乾为天（乾卦）自强不息\n上上卦\n象曰：困龙得水好运交，不由喜气上眉梢，一切谋望皆如意，向后时运渐渐高。\n这个卦是同卦（下乾上乾）相叠。象征天，喻龙（德才的君子），又象征纯粹的阳和健，表明兴盛强健。乾卦是根据万物变通的道理，以“元、亨、利、贞”为卦辞，示吉祥如意，教导人遵守天道的德行。\n第2卦 坤\n坤为地（坤卦）厚德载物\n上上卦\n象曰：肥羊失群入山岗，饿虎逢之把口张，适口充肠心欢喜，卦若占之大吉昌。\n这个卦是同卦（下坤上坤）相叠，阴性。象征地（与乾卦相反），顺从天。承载万物，伸展无穷无尽。坤卦以雌马为象征，表明地道生育抚养万物，而又依天顺时，性情温顺。它以“先迷后得”证明“坤”顺从“乾”，依随“乾”，才能把握正确方向，遵循正道，获取吉利。\n第3卦 屯\n水雷屯（屯卦）起始维艰\n下下卦\n象曰：风刮乱丝不见头，颠三倒四犯忧愁，慢从款来左顺遂，急促反惹不自由。\n这个卦是异卦（下震上坎）相叠，震为雷，喻动；坎为雨，喻险。雷雨交加，险象丛生，环境恶劣。“屯”原指植物萌生大地。万物始生，充满艰难险阻，然而顺时应运，必欣欣向荣。\n第4卦 蒙\n山水蒙（蒙卦）启蒙奋发\n中下卦\n象曰：卦中爻象犯小耗，君子占之运不高，婚姻合伙有琐碎，做事必然受苦劳。\n这个卦是异卦（下坎上艮）相叠，艮是山的形象，喻止；坎是水的形象，喻险。卦形为山下有险，仍不停止前进，是为蒙昧，故称蒙卦。但因把握时机，行动切合时宜，因此，具有启蒙和通达的卦象。\n第5卦 需\n水天需（需卦）守正待机\n中上卦\n象曰：明珠土埋日久深，无光无亮到如今，忽然大风吹土去，自然显露有重新。\n这个卦是异卦（下乾上坎）相叠，下卦是乾，刚健之意；上卦是坎，险陷之意。以刚逢险，宜稳健之妥，不可冒失行动，观时待变，所往一定成功。\n第6卦 讼\n天水讼（讼卦）慎争戒讼\n中下卦\n象曰：心中有事事难做，恰是二人争路走，雨下俱是要占先，谁肯让谁走一步。\n这个卦是异卦（下坎上乾）相叠。同需卦相反，互为“综卦”。乾为刚健，坎为险陷。刚与险，健与险，彼此反对，定生争讼。争讼非善事，务必慎重戒惧。\n第7卦 师\n地水师（师卦）行险而顺\n中上卦\n象曰：将帅领旨去出征，骑着烈马拉硬弓，百步穿杨去得准，箭中金钱喜气生。\n这个卦是异卦（下坎上坤）相叠。“师”指军队。坎为水、为险；坤为地、为顺，喻寓兵于农。兵凶战危，用兵乃圣人不得已而为之，但它可以顺利无阻碍地解决矛盾，因为顺乎形势，师出有名，故能化凶为吉。\n第8卦 比\n水地比（比卦）诚信团结\n上上卦\n象曰：顺风行船撒起帆，上天又助一蓬风，不用费力逍遥去，任意而行大亨通。\n这个卦是异卦（下坤上坎）相叠，坤为地；坎为水。水附大地，地纳河海，相互依赖，亲密无间。此卦与师卦完全相反，互为综卦。它阐述的是相亲相辅，宽宏无私，精诚团结的道理。\n第9卦 小畜\n风天小畜（小畜卦）蓄养待进\n下下卦\n象曰：苗逢旱天尽焦梢，水想云浓雨不浇，农人仰面长吁气，是从款来莫心高。\n这个卦是异卦（下乾上巽）相叠，乾为天；巽为风。喻风调雨顺，谷物滋长，故卦名小畜（蓄）。力量有限，须待发展到一定程度，才可大有作为。\n第10卦 履\n天泽履（履卦）脚踏实地\n中上卦\n象曰：凤凰落在西岐山，长鸣几声出圣贤，天降文王开基业，富贵荣华八百年。\n这个卦是异卦（下兑上乾）相叠，乾为天；兑为泽，以天喻君，以泽喻民，原文：“履（踩）虎尾、不咥（咬）人。”因此，结果吉利。君上民下，各得其位。兑柔遇乾刚，所履危。履意为实践，卦义是脚踏实地的向前进取的意思。\n第11卦 泰\n地天泰（泰卦）应时而变\n中中卦\n象曰：学文满腹入场闱，三元及第得意回，从今解去愁和闷，喜庆平地一声雷。\n这个卦是异卦（下乾上坤）相叠，乾为天，为阳；坤为地，为阴，阴阳交感，上下互通，天地相交，万物纷纭。反之则凶。万事万物，皆对立，转化，盛极必衰，衰而转盛，故应时而变者泰（通）。\n第12卦 否\n天地否(pǐ)（否卦）不交不通\n中中卦\n象曰：虎落陷坑不堪言，进前容易退后难，谋望不遂自己便，疾病口舌事牵连。\n这个卦是异卦（下坤上乾）相叠，其结构同泰卦相反，系阳气上升，阴气下降，天地不交，万物不通。它们彼此为“综卦”，表明泰极而否，否极泰来，互为因果。\n第13卦 同人\n天火同人（同人卦）上下和同\n中上卦\n象曰：心中有事犯猜疑，谋望从前不着实，幸遇明人来指引，诸般忧闷自消之。\n这个卦是异卦（下离上乾）相叠，乾为天，为君；离为火，为臣民百姓，上天下火，火性上升，同于天，上下和同，同舟共济，人际关系和谐，天下大同。\n第14卦 大有\n火天大有（大有卦）顺天依时\n上上卦\n象曰：砍树摸雀作事牢，是非口舌自然消，婚姻合伙不费力，若问走失未逃脱。\n这个卦是异卦（下乾上离）相叠。上卦为离，为火；下卦为乾，为天。火在天上，普照万物，万民归顺，顺天依时，大有所成。\n第15卦 谦\n地山谦（谦卦）内高外低\n中中卦\n象曰：天赐贫人一封金，不争不抢两平分，彼此分得金到手，一切谋望皆遂心。\n这个卦是异卦（下艮上坤）相叠，艮为山，坤为地。地面有山，地卑（低）而山高，是为内高外低，比喻功高不自居，名高不自誉，位高不自傲。这就是谦。\n第16卦 豫\n雷地豫（豫卦）顺时依势\n中中卦\n象曰：太公插下杏黄旗，收妖为徒归西岐，自此青龙得了位，一旦谋望百事宜。\n这个卦是异卦（下坤上震）相叠，坤为地，为顺；震为雷，为动。雷依时出，预示大地回春。因顺而动，和乐之源。此卦与谦卦互为综卦，交互作用。\n第17卦 随\n泽雷随（随卦）随时变通\n中中卦\n象曰：泥里步踏这几年，推车靠崖在眼前，目下就该再使力，扒上崖去发财源。\n这个卦是异卦（下震上兑）相叠，震为雷、为动；兑为悦。动而悦就是“随”。随指相互顺从，己有随物，物能随己，彼此沟通。随必依时顺势，有原则和条件，以坚贞为前提。\n第18卦 蛊\n山风蛊（蛊卦）振疲起衰\n中中卦\n象曰：卦中爻象如推磨，顺当为福反为祸，心中有益且迟迟，凡事尽从忙处错。\n这个卦是异卦（下巽上艮）相叠，与随卦互为综卦。蛊（gu）本意为事，引申为多事、混乱。器皿久不用而生虫称“蛊”，喻天下久安而因循、腐败，必须革新创造，治理整顿，挽救危机，重振事业。\n第19卦 临\n地泽临（临卦）教民保民\n中上卦\n象曰：君王无道民倒悬，常想拨云见青天，幸逢明主施仁政，重又安居乐自然。\n这个卦是异卦（下兑上坤）相叠。坤为地；兑为泽，地高于泽，泽容于地。喻君主亲临天下，治国安邦，上下融洽。\n第20卦 观\n风地观（观卦）观下瞻上\n中上卦\n象曰：卦遇蓬花旱逢河，生意买卖利息多，婚姻自有人来助，出门永不受折磨。\n这个卦是异卦（下坤上巽）相叠，风行地上，喻德教遍施。观卦与临卦互为综卦，交相使用。在上者以道义观天下；在下者以敬仰瞻上，人心顺服归从。\n第21卦 噬嗑\n火雷噬嗑（噬嗑卦）刚柔相济\n上上卦\n象曰：运拙如同身受饥，幸得送饭又送食，适口充腹心欢喜，忧愁从此渐消移。\n这个卦是异卦（下震上离）相叠。离为阴卦；震为阳卦。阴阳相交，咬碎硬物，喻恩威并施，宽严结合，刚柔相济。噬嗑（shihe）为上下颚咬合，咀嚼。\n第22卦 贲\n山火贲（贲卦）饰外扬质\n中上卦\n象曰：近来运转瑞气周，窈窕淑女君子求。钟鼓乐之大吉庆，占者逢之喜临头。\n这个卦是异卦（下离上艮）相叠。离为火为明；艮为山为止。文明而有节制。贲（bi）卦论述文与质的关系，以质为主，以文调节。贲，文饰、修饰。\n第23卦 剥\n山地剥（剥卦）顺势而止\n中下卦\n象曰：鹊遇天晚宿林中，不知林内先有鹰，虽然同处心生恶，卦若逢之是非轻。\n这个卦是异卦（下坤上艮）相叠。五阴在下，一阳在上，阴盛而阳孤；高山附于地。二者都是剥落象，故为“剥卦”。此卦阴盛阳衰，喻小人得势，君子困顿，事业败坏。\n第24卦 复\n地雷复（复卦）寓动于顺\n中中卦\n象曰：马氏太公不相合，世人占之忧疑多，恩人无义反为怨，是非平地起风波。\n这个卦是异卦（下震上坤）相叠。震为雷、为动；坤为地、为顺，动则顺，顺其自然。动在顺中，内阳外阴，循序运动，进退自如，利于前进。\n第25卦 无妄\n天雷无妄（无妄卦）无妄而得\n下下卦\n象曰：飞鸟失机落笼中，纵然奋飞不能腾，目下只宜守本分，妄想扒高万不能。\n这个卦是异卦（下震上乾）相叠。乾为天为刚为健；震为雷为刚为动。动而健，刚阳盛，人心振奋，必有所得，但唯循纯正，不可妄行。无妄必有获，必可致福。\n第26卦 大畜\n山天大畜（大畜卦）止而不止\n中上卦\n象曰：忧愁常锁两眉头，千头万绪挂心间，从今以后防开阵，任意行而不相干。\n这个卦是异卦（下乾上艮）相叠。乾为天，刚健；艮为山，笃实。畜者积聚，大畜意为大积蓄。为此不畏严重的艰难险阻，努力修身养性以丰富德业。\n第27卦 颐\n山雷颐（颐卦）纯正以养\n上上卦\n象曰：太公独钓渭水河，手执丝杆忧愁多，时来又遇文王访，自此永不受折磨。\n这个卦是异卦（下震上艮）相叠。震为雷，艮为山。山在上而雷在下，外实内虚。春暖万物养育，依时养贤育民。阳实阴虚，实者养人，虚者为人养。自食其力。\n第28卦 大过\n泽风大过（大过卦）非常行动\n中下卦\n象曰：夜晚梦里梦金银，醒来仍不见一文，目下只宜求本分，思想络是空劳神。\n这个卦是异卦（下巽上兑）相叠。兑为泽、为悦，巽为木、为顺，泽水淹舟，遂成大错。阴阳爻相反，阳大阴小，行动非常，有过度形象，内刚外柔。\n第29卦 坎\n坎为水（坎卦）行险用险\n下下卦\n象曰：一轮明月照水中，只见影儿不见踪，愚夫当财下去取，摸来摸去一场空。\n这个卦是同卦（下坎上坎）相叠。坎为水、为险，两坎相重，险上加险，险阻重重。一阳陷二阴。所幸阴虚阳实，诚信可豁然贯通。虽险难重重，却方能显人性光彩。\n第30卦

晋\n火地晋（晋卦）求进发展\n中上卦\n象曰：锄地锄去苗里草，谁想财帛将人找，一锄锄出银子来，这个运气也算好。\n这个卦是异卦（下坤上离）相叠。离为日，为光明；坤为地。太阳高悬，普照大地，大地卑顺，万物生长，光明磊落，柔进上行，喻事业蒸蒸日上。\n第36卦

            "content": "<周易2>\n第38卦 睽\n火泽睽（睽卦）异中求同\n下下卦\n象曰：此卦占来运气歹，如同太公作买卖，贩猪牛快贩羊迟，猪羊齐贩断了宰。\n这个卦是异卦（下兑上离）相叠。离为火；兑为泽。上火下泽，相违不相济。克则生，往复无空。万物有所不同，必有所异，相互矛盾。睽即矛盾。\n第39卦 蹇\n水山蹇（蹇卦）险阻在前\n下下卦\n象曰：大雨倾地雪满天，路上行人苦又寒，拖泥带水费尽力，事不遂心且耐烦。\n这个卦是异卦（下艮上坎）相叠。坎为水；艮为山。山高水深，困难重重，人生险阻，见险而止，明哲保身，可谓智慧。蹇，跋行艰难。\n第40卦 解\n雷水解（解卦）柔道致治\n中上卦\n象曰：目下月令如过关，千辛万苦受熬煎，时来恰相有人救，任意所为不相干。\n这个卦是异卦（下坎上震）相叠。震为雷、为动；坎为水、为险。险在内，动在外。严冬天地闭塞，静极而动。万象更新，冬去春来，一切消除，是为解。\n第41卦 损\n山泽损（损卦）损益制衡\n下下卦\n象曰：时运不至费心多，比作推车受折磨，山路崎岖吊下耳，左插右按按不着。\n这个卦是异卦（下兑上艮）相叠。艮为山；兑为泽。上山下泽，大泽浸蚀山根。损益相间，损中有益，益中有损。二者之间，不可不慎重对待。损下益上，治理国家，过度会损伤国基。应损则损，但必量力、适度。少损而益最佳。\n第42卦 益\n风雷益（益卦）损上益下\n上上卦\n象曰：时来运转吉气发，多年枯木又开花，枝叶重生多茂盛，几人见了几人夸。\n这个卦是异卦（下震上巽）相叠。巽为风；震为雷。风雷激荡，其势愈强，雷愈响，风雷相助互长，交相助益。此卦与损卦相反。它是损上以益下，后者是损下以益上。二卦阐述的是损益的原则。\n第43卦 夬\n泽天夬 （夬卦） 决而能和\n上上卦\n象曰：蜘蛛脱网赛天军，粘住游蜂翅翎毛，幸有大风吹破网，脱离灾难又逍遥。\n这个卦是异卦（下乾上兑）相叠。乾为天为健；兑为泽为悦。泽气上升，决注成雨，雨施大地，滋润万物。五阳去一阴，去之不难，决（去之意）即可，故名为夬（guài），夬即决。\n第44卦 姤\n天风姤（姤卦） 天下有风\n上卦\n象曰：他乡遇友喜气欢，须知运气福重添，自今交了顺当运，向后管保不相干。\n这个卦是异卦（下巽上乾）相叠。乾为天；巽为风。天下有风，吹遍大地，阴阳交合，万物茂盛。姤（gòu）卦与夬卦相反，互为“综卦”。姤即遘，阴阳相遇。但五阳一阴，不能长久相处。\n第45卦 萃\n泽地萃（萃卦）荟萃聚集\n中上卦\n象曰：游鱼戏水被网惊，跳过龙门身化龙，三尺杨柳垂金线，万朵桃花显你能。\n这个卦是异卦相叠（下坤上兑）。坤为地、为顺；兑为泽、为水。泽泛滥淹没大地，人众多相互斗争，危机必四伏，务必顺天任贤，未雨绸缪，柔顺而又和悦，彼此相得益彰，安居乐业。萃，聚集、团结。\n第46卦 升\n地风升（升卦）柔顺谦虚\n上上卦\n象曰：士人来占必得名，生意买卖也兴隆，匠艺逢之交易好，农间庄稼亦收成。\n这个卦是异卦相叠（下巽上坤）。坤为地、为顺；巽为木、为逊。大地生长树木，逐步的成长，日渐高大成材，喻事业步步高升，前程远大，故名“升”。\n第47卦 困\n泽水困（困卦）困境求通\n中上卦\n象曰：时运不来好伤怀，撮上押去把梯抬，一筒虫翼无到手，转了上去下不来。\n这个卦是异卦（下坎上兑）相叠。兑为阴为泽喻悦；坎为阳为水喻险。泽水困，陷入困境，才智难以施展，仍坚守正道，自得其乐，必可成事，摆脱困境。\n第48卦 井\n水风井（井卦）求贤若渴\n上上卦\n象曰：枯井破费已多年，一朝流泉出来鲜，资生济渴人称羡，时来运转喜自然。\n这个卦是异卦（下巽上坎）相叠。坎为水；巽为木。树木得水而蓬勃生长。人靠水井生活，水井由人挖掘而成。相互为养，井以水养人，经久不竭，人应取此德而勤劳自勉。\n第49卦 革\n泽火革（革卦）顺天应人\n上上卦\n象曰：苗逢旱天渐渐衰，幸得天恩降雨来，忧去喜来能变化，求谋干事遂心怀。\n这个卦是异卦（下离上兑）相叠。离为火；兑为泽，泽内有水。水在上而下浇，火在下而上升。火旺水干；水大火熄。二者相生亦相克，必然出现变革。变革是宇宙的基本规律。\n第50卦 鼎\n火风鼎（鼎卦）稳重图变\n中下卦\n象曰：莺鹜蛤蜊落沙滩，蛤蜊莺鹜两翅扇，渔人进前双得利，失走行人却自在。\n这个卦是异卦（下巽上离）相叠。燃木煮食，化生为熟，除旧布新的意思。鼎为重宝大器，三足稳重之象。煮食，喻食物充足，不再有困难和困扰。在此基础上宜变革，发展事业。\n第51卦 震\n震为雷（震卦）临危不乱\n中上卦\n象曰：一口金钟在淤泥，人人拿着当玩石，忽然一日钟悬起，响亮一声天下知。\n这个卦是同卦（下震上震）相叠。震为雷，两震相叠，反响巨大，可消除沉闷之气，亨通畅达。平日应居安思危，怀恐惧心理，不敢有所怠慢，遇到突发事变，也能安然自若，谈笑如常。\n第52卦 艮\n艮为山（艮卦）动静适时\n中下卦\n象曰：财帛常打心头走，可惜眼前难到手，不如意时且忍耐，逢着闲事休开口。\n这个卦是同卦（下艮上艮）相叠。艮为山，二山相重，喻静止。它和震卦相反。高潮过后，必然出现低潮，进入事物的相对静止阶段。静止如山，宜止则止，宜行则行。行止即动和静，都不可失机，应恰到好处，动静得宜，适可而止。\n第53卦 渐\n风山渐（渐卦）渐进蓄德\n上上卦\n象曰：俊鸟幸得出笼中，脱离灾难显威风，一朝得意福力至，东西南北任意行。\n这个卦是异卦（下艮上巽）相叠。艮为山；巽为木。山上有木，逐渐成长，山也随着增高。这是逐渐进步的过程，所以称渐，渐即进，渐渐前进而不急速。\n第54卦 归妹\n雷泽归妹（归妹卦）立家兴业\n下下卦\n象曰：求鱼须当向水中，树上求之不顺情，受尽爬揭难随意，劳而无功运平平。\n这个卦是异卦（下兑上震）相叠。震为动、为长男；兑为悦、为少女。以少女从长男，产生爱慕之情，有婚姻之动，有嫁女之象，故称归妹。男婚女嫁，天地大义，人的开始和终结。上卦与渐卦为综卦，交互为用。\n第55卦 丰\n雷火丰（丰卦）日中则斜\n上上卦\n象曰：古镜昏暗好几年，一朝磨明似月圆，君子谋事逢此卦，时来运转喜自然。\n这个卦是异卦（下离上震）相叠，电闪雷鸣，成就巨大，喻达到顶峰，如日中天。告诫；务必注意事物向相反方面发展。治乱相因，盛衰无常，不可不警惕。\n第56卦 旅\n火山旅（旅卦）依义顺时\n下下卦\n象曰：飞鸟树上垒窝巢，小人使计举火烧，君占此卦为不吉，一切谋望枉徒劳。\n这个卦是异卦（下艮上离）相叠。此卦与丰卦相反，互为“综卦”。山中燃火，烧而不止，火势不停地向前蔓延，如同途中行人，急于赶路。因而称旅卦。\n第57卦 巽\n巽为风（巽卦）谦逊受益\n中上卦\n象曰：一叶孤舟落沙滩，有篙无水进退难，时逢大雨江湖溢，不用费力任往返。\n这个卦是同卦（下巽上巽）相叠，巽（xùn）为风，两风相重，长风不绝，无孔不入，巽义为顺。谦逊的态度和行为可无往不利。\n第58卦 兑\n兑为泽（兑卦）刚内柔外\n上上卦\n象曰：这个卦象真可取，觉着做事不费力，休要错过这机关，事事觉得随心意。\n这个卦是同卦（下泽上泽）相叠。泽为水。两泽相连，两水交流，上下相和，团结一致，朋友相助，欢欣喜悦。兑为悦也。同秉刚健之德，外抱柔和之姿，坚行正道，导民向上。\n第59卦 涣\n风水涣（涣卦）拯救涣散\n下下卦\n象曰：隔河望见一锭金，欲取岸宽水又深，指望资财难到手，昼思夜想枉费心。\n这个卦是异卦（下坎上巽）相叠。风在水上行，推波助澜，四方流溢。涣，水流流散之意。象征组织和人心涣散，必用积极的手段和方法克服，战胜弊端，挽救涣散，转危为安。\n第60卦 节\n水泽节（节卦）万物有节\n上上卦\n象曰：时来运转喜气生，登台封神姜太公，到此诸神皆退位，纵然有祸不成凶。\n这个卦是异卦（下兑上坎）相叠。兑为泽；坎为水。泽有水而流有限，多必溢于泽外。因此要有节度，故称节。节卦与涣卦相反，互为综卦，交相使用。天地有节度才能常新，国家有节度才能安稳，个人有节度才能完美。\n第61卦 中孚\n风泽中孚（中孚卦）诚信立身\n下下卦\n象曰：路上行人色匆匆，急忙无桥过薄冰，小心谨慎过得去，一步错了落水中。\n这个卦是异卦（下兑上巽）相叠。孚（fú）本义孵，孵卵出壳的日期非常准确，有信的意义。卦形外实内虚，喻心中诚信，所以称中孚卦。这是立身处世的根本。\n第62卦 小过\n雷山小过（小过卦）行动有度\n中上卦\n象曰：行人路过独木桥，心内惶恐眼里瞧，爽利保你过得去，慢行一定不安牢。\n这个卦是异卦（下艮上震）相叠。艮为山；震为雷。过山雷鸣，不可不畏惧。阳为大，阴为小，卦外四阴超过中二阳，故称“小过”，小有越过。\n第63卦 既济\n水火既济（既济卦）盛极将衰\n中上卦\n象曰：金榜以上题姓名，不负当年苦用功，人逢此卦名吉庆，一切谋望大亨通。\n这个卦是异卦（下离上坎）相叠。坎为水；离为火。水火相交，水在火上，水势压倒火势，救火大功告成。既，已经；济，成也。既济就是事情已经成功，但终将发生变故。\n第64卦 未济\n火水未济（未济卦）事业未竟\n中下卦\n象曰：离地着人几丈深，是防偷营劫寨人，后封太岁为凶煞，时加谨慎祸不侵。\n这个卦是异卦（下坎上离）相叠。离为火；坎为水。火上水下，火势压倒水势，救火大功未成，故称未济。《周易》以乾坤二卦为始，以既济、未济二卦为终，充分反映了变化发展的思想。\n</周易2>",

                "content": "<周易1>\n第1卦 乾\n乾为天（乾卦）自强不息\n上上卦\n象曰：困龙得水好运交，不由喜气上眉梢，一切谋望皆如意，向后时运渐渐高。\n这个卦是同卦（下乾上乾）相叠。象征天，喻龙（德才的君子），又象征纯粹的阳和健，表明兴盛强健。乾卦是根据万物变通的道理，以“元、亨、利、贞”为卦辞，示吉祥如意，教导人遵守天道的德行。\n第2卦 坤\n坤为地（坤卦）厚德载物\n上上卦\n象曰：肥羊失群入山岗，饿虎逢之把口张，适口充肠心欢喜，卦若占之大吉昌。\n这个卦是同卦（下坤上坤）相叠，阴性。象征地（与乾卦相反），顺从天。承载万物，伸展无穷无尽。坤卦以雌马为象征，表明地道生育抚养万物，而又依天顺时，性情温顺。它以“先迷后得”证明“坤”顺从“乾”，依随“乾”，才能把握正确方向，遵循正道，获取吉利。\n第3卦 屯\n水雷屯（屯卦）起始维艰\n下下卦\n象曰：风刮乱丝不见头，颠三倒四犯忧愁，慢从款来左顺遂，急促反惹不自由。\n这个卦是异卦（下震上坎）相叠，震为雷，喻动；坎为雨，喻险。雷雨交加，险象丛生，环境恶劣。“屯”原指植物萌生大地。万物始生，充满艰难险阻，然而顺时应运，必欣欣向荣。\n第4卦 蒙\n山水蒙（蒙卦）启蒙奋发\n中下卦\n象曰：卦中爻象犯小耗，君子占之运不高，婚姻合伙有琐碎，做事必然受苦劳。\n这个卦是异卦（下坎上艮）相叠，艮是山的形象，喻止；坎是水的形象，喻险。卦形为山下有险，仍不停止前进，是为蒙昧，故称蒙卦。但因把握时机，行动切合时宜，因此，具有启蒙和通达的卦象。\n第5卦 需\n水天需（需卦）守正待机\n中上卦\n象曰：明珠土埋日久深，无光无亮到如今，忽然大风吹土去，自然显露有重新。\n这个卦是异卦（下乾上坎）相叠，下卦是乾，刚健之意；上卦是坎，险陷之意。以刚逢险，宜稳健之妥，不可冒失行动，观时待变，所往一定成功。\n第6卦 讼\n天水讼（讼卦）慎争戒讼\n中下卦\n象曰：心中有事事难做，恰是二人争路走，雨下俱是要占先，谁肯让谁走一步。\n这个卦是异卦（下坎上乾）相叠。同需卦相反，互为“综卦”。乾为刚健，坎为险陷。刚与险，健与险，彼此反对，定生争讼。争讼非善事，务必慎重戒惧。\n第7卦 师\n地水师（师卦）行险而顺\n中上卦\n象曰：将帅领旨去出征，骑着烈马拉硬弓，百步穿杨去得准，箭中金钱喜气生。\n这个卦是异卦（下坎上坤）相叠。“师”指军队。坎为水、为险；坤为地、为顺，喻寓兵于农。兵凶战危，用兵乃圣人不得已而为之，但它可以顺利无阻碍地解决矛盾，因为顺乎形势，师出有名，故能化凶为吉。\n第8卦 比\n水地比（比卦）诚信团结\n上上卦\n象曰：顺风行船撒起帆，上天又助一蓬风，不用费力逍遥去，任意而行大亨通。\n这个卦是异卦（下坤上坎）相叠，坤为地；坎为水。水附大地，地纳河海，相互依赖，亲密无间。此卦与师卦完全相反，互为综卦。它阐述的是相亲相辅，宽宏无私，精诚团结的道理。\n第9卦 小畜\n风天小畜（小畜卦）蓄养待进\n下下卦\n象曰：苗逢旱天尽焦梢，水想云浓雨不浇，农人仰面长吁气，是从款来莫心高。\n这个卦是异卦（下乾上巽）相叠，乾为天；巽为风。喻风调雨顺，谷物滋长，故卦名小畜（蓄）。力量有限，须待发展到一定程度，才可大有作为。\n第10卦 履\n天泽履（履卦）脚踏实地\n中上卦\n象曰：凤凰落在西岐山，长鸣几声出圣贤，天降文王开基业，富贵荣华八百年。\n这个卦是异卦（下兑上乾）相叠，乾为天；兑为泽，以天喻君，以泽喻民，原文：“履（踩）虎尾、不咥（咬）人。”因此，结果吉利。君上民下，各得其位。兑柔遇乾刚，所履危。履意为实践，卦义是脚踏实地的向前进取的意思。\n第11卦 泰\n地天泰（泰卦）应时而变\n中中卦\n象曰：学文满腹入场闱，三元及第得意回，从今解去愁和闷，喜庆平地一声雷。\n这个卦是异卦（下乾上坤）相叠，乾为天，为阳；坤为地，为阴，阴阳交感，上下互通，天地相交，万物纷纭。反之则凶。万事万物，皆对立，转化，盛极必衰，衰而转盛，故应时而变者泰（通）。\n第12卦 否\n天地否(pǐ)（否卦）不交不通\n中中卦\n象曰：虎落陷坑不堪言，进前容易退后难，谋望不遂自己便，疾病口舌事牵连。\n这个卦是异卦（下坤上乾）相叠，其结构同泰卦相反，系阳气上升，阴气下降，天地不交，万物不通。它们彼此为“综卦”，表明泰极而否，否极泰来，互为因果。\n第13卦 同人\n天火同人（同人卦）上下和同\n中上卦\n象曰：心中有事犯猜疑，谋望从前不着实，幸遇明人来指引，诸般忧闷自消之。\n这个卦是异卦（下离上乾）相叠，乾为天，为君；离为火，为臣民百姓，上天下火，火性上升，同于天，上下和同，同舟共济，人际关系和谐，天下大同。\n第14卦 大有\n火天大有（大有卦）顺天依时\n上上卦\n象曰：砍树摸雀作事牢，是非口舌自然消，婚姻合伙不费力，若问走失未逃脱。\n这个卦是异卦（下乾上离）相叠。上卦为离，为火；下卦为乾，为天。火在天上，普照万物，万民归顺，顺天依时，大有所成。\n第15卦 谦\n地山谦（谦卦）内高外低\n中中卦\n象曰：天赐贫人一封金，不争不抢两平分，彼此分得金到手，一切谋望皆遂心。\n这个卦是异卦（下艮上坤）相叠，艮为山，坤为地。地面有山，地卑（低）而山高，是为内高外低，比喻功高不自居，名高不自誉，位高不自傲。这就是谦。\n第16卦 豫\n雷地豫（豫卦）顺时依势\n中中卦\n象曰：太公插下杏黄旗，收妖为徒归西岐，自此青龙得了位，一旦谋望百事宜。\n这个卦是异卦（下坤上震）相叠，坤为地，为顺；震为雷，为动。雷依时出，预示大地回春。因顺而动，和乐之源。此卦与谦卦互为综卦，交互作用。\n第17卦 随\n泽雷随（随卦）随时变通\n中中卦\n象曰：泥里步踏这几年，推车靠崖在眼前，目下就该再使力，扒上崖去发财源。\n这个卦是异卦（下震上兑）相叠，震为雷、为动；兑为悦。动而悦就是“随”。随指相互顺从，己有随物，物能随己，彼此沟通。随必依时顺势，有原则和条件，以坚贞为前提。\n第18卦 蛊\n山风蛊（蛊卦）振疲起衰\n中中卦\n象曰：卦中爻象如推磨，顺当为福反为祸，心中有益且迟迟，凡事尽从忙处错。\n这个卦是异卦（下巽上艮）相叠，与随卦互为综卦。蛊（gu）本意为事，引申为多事、混乱。器皿久不用而生虫称“蛊”，喻天下久安而因循、腐败，必须革新创造，治理整顿，挽救危机，重振事业。\n第19卦 临\n地泽临（临卦）教民保民\n中上卦\n象曰：君王无道民倒悬，常想拨云见青天，幸逢明主施仁政，重又安居乐自然。\n这个卦是异卦（下兑上坤）相叠。坤为地；兑为泽，地高于泽，泽容于地。喻君主亲临天下，治国安邦，上下融洽。\n第20卦 观\n风地观（观卦）观下瞻上\n中上卦\n象曰：卦遇蓬花旱逢河，生意买卖利息多，婚姻自有人来助，出门永不受折磨。\n这个卦是异卦（下坤上巽）相叠，风行地上，喻德教遍施。观卦与临卦互为综卦，交相使用。在上者以道义观天下；在下者以敬仰瞻上，人心顺服归从。\n第21卦 噬嗑\n火雷噬嗑（噬嗑卦）刚柔相济\n上上卦\n象曰：运拙如同身受饥，幸得送饭又送食，适口充腹心欢喜，忧愁从此渐消移。\n这个卦是异卦（下震上离）相叠。离为阴卦；震为阳卦。阴阳相交，咬碎硬物，喻恩威并施，宽严结合，刚柔相济。噬嗑（shihe）为上下颚咬合，咀嚼。\n第22卦 贲\n山火贲（贲卦）饰外扬质\n中上卦\n象曰：近来运转瑞气周，窈窕淑女君子求。钟鼓乐之大吉庆，占者逢之喜临头。\n这个卦是异卦（下离上艮）相叠。离为火为明；艮为山为止。文明而有节制。贲（bi）卦论述文与质的关系，以质为主，以文调节。贲，文饰、修饰。\n第23卦 剥\n山地剥（剥卦）顺势而止\n中下卦\n象曰：鹊遇天晚宿林中，不知林内先有鹰，虽然同处心生恶，卦若逢之是非轻。\n这个卦是异卦（下坤上艮）相叠。五阴在下，一阳在上，阴盛而阳孤；高山附于地。二者都是剥落象，故为“剥卦”。此卦阴盛阳衰，喻小人得势，君子困顿，事业败坏。\n第24卦 复\n地雷复（复卦）寓动于顺\n中中卦\n象曰：马氏太公不相合，世人占之忧疑多，恩人无义反为怨，是非平地起风波。\n这个卦是异卦（下震上坤）相叠。震为雷、为动；坤为地、为顺，动则顺，顺其自然。动在顺中，内阳外阴，循序运动，进退自如，利于前进。\n第25卦 无妄\n天雷无妄（无妄卦）无妄而得\n下下卦\n象曰：飞鸟失机落笼中，纵然奋飞不能腾，目下只宜守本分，妄想扒高万不能。\n这个卦是异卦（下震上乾）相叠。乾为天为刚为健；震为雷为刚为动。动而健，刚阳盛，人心振奋，必有所得，但唯循纯正，不可妄行。无妄必有获，必可致福。\n第26卦 大畜\n山天大畜（大畜卦）止而不止\n中上卦\n象曰：忧愁常锁两眉头，千头万绪挂心间，从今以后防开阵，任意行而不相干。\n这个卦是异卦（下乾上艮）相叠。乾为天，刚健；艮为山，笃实。畜者积聚，大畜意为大积蓄。为此不畏严重的艰难险阻，努力修身养性以丰富德业。\n第27卦 颐\n山雷颐（颐卦）纯正以养\n上上卦\n象曰：太公独钓渭水河，手执丝杆忧愁多，时来又遇文王访，自此永不受折磨。\n这个卦是异卦（下震上艮）相叠。震为雷，艮为山。山在上而雷在下，外实内虚。春暖万物养育，依时养贤育民。阳实阴虚，实者养人，虚者为人养。自食其力。\n第28卦 大过\n泽风大过（大过卦）非常行动\n中下卦\n象曰：夜晚梦里梦金银，醒来仍不见一文，目下只宜求本分，思想络是空劳神。\n这个卦是异卦（下巽上兑）相叠。兑为泽、为悦，巽为木、为顺，泽水淹舟，遂成大错。阴阳爻相反，阳大阴小，行动非常，有过度形象，内刚外柔。\n第29卦
